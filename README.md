# Super World - A 4th & 5th Grade Gemini Creation!

## üåç About The Game

**Super World** is a turn-based (real-time with pauses) strategy game where the goal is **world domination!** Players start with a home territory and must strategically build up their forces, conquer neutral lands, and ultimately defeat AI opponents to control the entire map.

This game was inspired by and iteratively developed with a creative team of **4th and 5th graders** who provided the core concepts, gameplay ideas, and continuous feedback. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code was generated and refined with the assistance of **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model**.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Dynamic Map:** Start with a set of core territories and watch as new neutral lands dynamically appear, changing the strategic landscape.
*   **Troop Generation:** Territories automatically generate troops over time.
*   **Strategic Combat:**
    *   Click your territory, then an adjacent enemy or neutral territory to attack.
    *   Battles are resolved based on troop numbers, with attack and defense upgrades influencing outcomes.
    *   Visual battle effects with emojis (üí•) and flash animations!
*   **AI Opponents:** Face off against multiple computer-controlled players (AI Alpha - Red, AI Gamma - Green).
*   **Diplomacy (Simple Alliances):**
    *   Form (and break) alliances with AI players.
    *   Allied AIs will not initiate attacks against you, but beware ‚Äì alliances can be broken!
*   **Upgrade System:**
    *   Earn Gold from your controlled territories.
    *   Spend Gold to upgrade:
        *   **Troop Production:** Generate more troops faster.
        *   **Attack Strength:** Make your attacking units more effective.
        *   **Defense Strength:** Bolster your units when defending.

## üéÆ How to Play

1.  **Download/Clone:** Get the `super_world.html` (or the latest version name) file.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the HTML file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  **Your Goal:** You are the **Blue** player. Your objective is to conquer all other territories on the map.
4.  **Selecting & Attacking:**
    *   Click on one of your **Blue** territories that has more than 1 troop. It will be highlighted with a gold border.
    *   Adjacent attackable enemy (Red, Green) or neutral (Grey/Beige) territories will pulse with a yellow highlight.
    *   Click on a highlighted (or any valid adjacent enemy/neutral) territory to launch an attack. Your territory will send all its troops minus one.
5.  **Troop & Gold Generation:**
    *   Your territories automatically generate troops each "Game Day."
    *   You also earn 1 Gold per territory per "Game Day."
6.  **Alliances:**
    *   Use the "Ally with Red" or "Ally with Green" buttons in the "Actions" panel.
    *   The button text will change to "Break Alliance..." if you are currently allied.
    *   An AI you are allied with will generally not attack you. Attacking an ally will break the alliance.
7.  **Upgrades:**
    *   Use your accumulated Gold to purchase upgrades from the "Upgrades" section in the "Actions" panel.
    *   Upgrade costs increase with each level.
8.  **Winning/Losing:**

    *   You lose if all your territories are conquered.
9.  **Restart:** Use the "Restart Game" button at any time to start a new campaign.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Story

This project is a fantastic example of human-AI collaboration in a creative and educational setting.

*   **The Visionaries:** A team of enthusiastic 4th and 5th-grade students. They brainstormed the core game mechanics, drew initial map concepts, suggested features like alliances and upgrades, and provided invaluable playtesting feedback.
*   **The Code Engine:** Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model translated the students' ideas and the facilitator's prompts into functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The process involved several iterations, with students reviewing AI-generated output and suggesting refinements and new features.

This game demonstrates how young minds, coupled with advanced AI tools, can bring exciting ideas to life!

## üöÄ Future Ideas (From the Student Team & Potential Enhancements)

*   More distinct troop types with different strengths/weaknesses.
*   More complex AI strategies and personalities.
*   Visual representation of troop movements.
*   Territory-specific upgrades or special resources.
*   Events or chance cards.
*   Sound effects.
*   A more detailed "Trust" system for alliances.
